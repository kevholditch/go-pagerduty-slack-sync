This tool syncs one or more pagerduty schedules to two slack groups per schedule.  The first slack group is a group with everyone who is in the pagerduty schedule and the second contains the current person on call.

For example if you have the following users in a pagerduty schedule:

```
schedule id: 1234
user1
user2
user3 <= currently on call
```

Then when you run a sync for the schedule using:

```
docker run -e RUN_INTERVAL_SECONDS=60 -e SLACK_TOKEN=xxx -e PAGERDUTY_TOKEN=xxx -e SCHEDULE_PLATFORM=1234,platform-engineer kevholditch/pagerduty-slack-sync:latest
```

The following slack groups would be created:

- `@all-oncall-platform-engineers` => `user1, user2, user3` 
- `@current-oncall-platform-engineer` => `user3`
    
Multiple schedules can be synced at once by passing many env variables beginning with `SCHEDULE_`.  The format for the value that the schedule parameter expects is `<pagerduty schedule id>/<group-name>`.  The `<group name>` will be used to build the two names for the slack groups using the following format:
    - `all-oncall-<group-name>s`
    - `current-oncall-<group-name>`

If there are multiple schedules with the same `<group-name>` are defined, then slack groups contains the combined list of all people for all the given schedules.

For instance given following environment variables:
```
-e SCHEDULE_TEAM_1=abcd,platform-engineer -e SCHEDULE_TEAM_2=efgh,platform-engineer
```

This will result in a pair of slack groups with the combined users:
- `@all-oncall-platform-engineers` => combined list of all users in `abcd` and `efgh` schedules
- `@current-oncall-platform-engineer` => combined list of current on call users in `abcd` and `efgh` schedules

## Slack permissions

In order for the app to run you will need to create a bot with the following permissions:
```
usergroups:read
usergroups:write
users:read
users:read.email
```

If you have locked down your slack so only the admins can create groups then you have two options.  You can either create the slack groups up front and the app will use those or you can give the bot user auth and give it admin perssions:
```
admin.usergroups:read
admin.usergroups:write
usergroups:read
usergroups:write
users:read
users:read.email
```
